It may encompass using insights to conceive,\nmodel and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The\ndiscipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more\nspecialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on\nparticular areas of technology and types of application.\n\nThe American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD, the\npredecessor of ABET)<ref name=\"ABET History\">[http://www.abet.org/History/ ABET\nHistory]</ref> has defined \"engineering\" as: <blockquote>The creative\napplication of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines,\napparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in\ncombination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their\ndesign; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all\nas respects an intended function, economics of operation or safety to life and\nproperty.<ref name=\"ECPD\nCanons\">[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/26393909&referer=brief_results\nEngineers' Council for Professional Development.
